William Shakespeare was a renowned English poet, playwright, and actor born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon.
His birthday is most commonly celebrated on 23 April (see When was Shakespeare born), which is also
believed to be the date he died in 1616.

Shakespeare was a prolific writer during the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages of British theatre (sometimes
called the English Renaissance or the Early Modern Period). Shakespeare’s plays are perhaps his most
enduring legacy, but they are not all he wrote. Shakespeare’s poems also remain popular to this day.
